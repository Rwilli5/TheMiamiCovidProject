Commonly asked questions

## If there is so much uncertainty with these models, what good are they?

The models provide predictions about the timing of the COVID-19 epidemic and the maximum number of people who may need hospitalization, need intensive care unit care and need ventilation.  This information can be used to help community leaders and medical facilities prepare.  The models also help us to see the impact of different interventions.  For example, we can see how increasing social distancing can reduce the maximum number of people who may need ventilation or delay the peak demand timing of it; thus allowing our health care system to keep up with the community needs.
